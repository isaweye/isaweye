### ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Greetings...

I exist to create and explore various things in the world of programming. I have experience with **HTML**, **PHP**, **JavaScript** (including **TypeScript**), **Java**, **Python**, and **Swift**. **Java** is my favorite language, and I usually code in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but sometimes I use editors like [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano).

### :computer: System

I'm currently using [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), which is based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). My GPU is an older **NVIDIA** model, which sometimes gives me trouble with **Linux** drivers.

### :bar_chart: Contributions

**I welcome collaboration and feedback!** If you have ideas to improve my projects or any suggestions, feel free to open **pull requests** or **issues**.
